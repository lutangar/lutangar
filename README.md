## Hi there, I'm Johan 👋
> Based in Lyon area, :fr: France

A __fullstack web developer__ in love with the *commons*.

- __Software craftsman__
- __Consultant__ for some, but I do love to get my hands dirty...

### Recent works

For the past years, I tried to mostly work on open-source techs.

##### PeerTube

> [__PeerTube__](https://joinpeertube.org/en_US/) is a "Free software to take back control of your videos"

I enjoy crafting plugins and contributing to [PeerTube](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube) core,
while working for the __French Ministry of Education__ which is deploying a lot of open-source software
*via* their platform [apps.education.fr](https://apps.education.fr/).

##### API.VIDEO

I appreciate collaborating with the people [@apivideo](https://github.com/apivideo) an international startup based in Bordeaux :wine:

I met them by posting and fixing a few issues on their ~~~nodejs client~~~ [legacy nodejs client](https://github.com/apivideo/nodejs-sdk).
But was then hired to maintain it and to help automate the deployment of their [generated API Clients](https://github.com/apivideo/api.video-api-client-generator) via __a ton's of __Github actions__ 

##### DisMoi
We worked hard [@dis-moi](https://github.com/dis-moi/) and gave birth to :fr: [__LeMêmeEnLocal__](https://lememe.fr/) a web extension focused on proposing locally sourced alternatives as you browse.

And the ~~original~~ more generalist and international [https://www.dismoi.io/](DisMoi).
> Would have love to decentralize this piece of software.

*random thoughts*

__git driven organization__
> I sometimes dream about a (somewhat too nerdy and way too technocratic) git driven organization...<br />
> ...and then recall we're just humans, and it'd probably end up in CyberPunk nightmare.

__proprietary software__

I do use some proprietary softwares.<br />
Some of which I sometimes recommend given the right context.<br />
...but I still have some addictions to some SAAS which I badly need to cure. :ill:
