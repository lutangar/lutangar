##### PeerTube
I enjoy crafting [__PeerTube__ plugins](https://gitlab.com/apps_education/peertube) and contributing to [PeerTube](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube) core,
while working for the __French Ministry of Education__ which is deploying a lot of open-source software
*via* their platform [apps.education.fr](https://apps.education.fr/).

##### api.video
I appreciate collaborating with the people [@apivideo](https://github.com/apivideo) an international startup based in Bordeaux. 🍷

I met them by posting and fixing a few issues on their ~~nodejs client~~ [legacy nodejs client](https://github.com/apivideo/nodejs-sdk).
But was then hired to maintain it and to help automate the deployment of their [generated API Clients](https://github.com/apivideo/api.video-api-client-generator) *via* __a ton's__ of __Github actions__

##### DisMoi
We worked hard [@dis-moi](https://github.com/dis-moi/) and gave birth to :fr: [__LeMêmeEnLocal__](https://lememe.fr/) a web extension focused on proposing locally sourced alternatives as you browse.
And the ~~original~~ more generalist and international [https://www.dismoi.io/](DisMoi).
> Would have love to decentralize this piece of software and embrace the __fediverse__.

I do use some __proprietary softwares__. Some of which I sometimes recommend given the right context.<br />
...but I still have some addictions to some other SAAS which I badly need to cure. 🤒
